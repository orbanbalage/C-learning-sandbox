Sometime during the summer of 2022, while doomscrolling on [Instagram, I got an ad](https://www.instagram.com/42prague/), inviting me to something that seemed too good to be true – [Free Collaborative Learning](https://www.42prague.com/) without a hierarchy, forced classes, in a gamified manner taken at your own pace? Could I actually be a part of a community of like-minded people and have fun learning C from scratch? Something I wish I had in high-school or even in Uni, but those systems were really only set me up for failure...

I applied, and unfortunately couldn't join right away in 2022, but in 2023 - and encouraged by a fellow Pisciner I started blogging about the journey here: [42Prague: C language Piscine tips and howto](https://piscine42prague.wordpress.com/).

After the Piscine there was some time to relax and recharge, and now in 2024 I joined the Core Curriculum.

I've also looked at more C materials and courses since the Piscine, and ran into a lot of unexpected intricacies of the language, or rather it's implementation and the standard's evolution.

This repo will host simple code that I will use to test and verify the concepts that I acquire along the way. There is also a blog that loosely goes with it here: [Learning C in 2024 – My personal journey as I unlearn JavaScript and figure out the quirks of the C programming language](https://cprogramming2024.wordpress.com/)
